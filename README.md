## spatialSONET
Generates Second Order Networks (SONETs) with prescribed second order motif frequencies and double-sided spatial factor.  Simulates the spiking neuron networks with Brian2 simulator.  Analyzes simulation results with synchronous event detection.

## Overview
Python code that generates random directed graphs with prescribed second order statistcs and one-dimensional spatial structure.  Additional structure (i.e., higher-order statistics) are approximately minimized.
